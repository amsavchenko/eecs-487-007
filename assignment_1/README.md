# Assignment 1

**Full description and links can be found at [official class page](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/assignment1.html).**

In this assignment, you will first learn how to use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) environment. Then, you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Develop proficiency with PyTorch tensors
- Gain experience using notebooks on Google Colab
- Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
- Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning
- Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
