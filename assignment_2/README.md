**Full description and links can be found at [official class page](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/assignment1.html).**

In this assignment, you will implement various image classification  models, based on the SVM / Softmax / 2-layer Neural Network. The goals  of this assignment are as follows:

- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Implement and apply a Softmax classifier
- Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- Practice implementing vectorized gradient code by checking against naive implementations, and using numeric gradient checking
